Introduction: OSCA Is a booking system to manage doctor
patients scheduling their appointment from time to time. It
will make patients and doctors well-oriented, which Is
bound by times. Patients can book upcoming times for
him/her, which will make their life great and straightforward.
Only fillup registration form, and then the system will take
care of the rest. No hassle of time clashing and waiting.
Time is vital for the future.

Background Study: We searched ThemeForest to get
ideas. Then we find out a WordPress theme called the
medical clinic. We choose that layout for the frontend.
Amelia WordPress Plugin inspires the Appointment system
and scheduling. One of our team worked with that plugin
and theme, so we find out the essential parts to
demonstrate in this project because of our summertime
shortage.

Impact of this project:

We can feel the pain of waiting just before the chamber of a doctor. Doctors sometimes
forgot about their appointment because of under pressure. So we build a platform like
an appointment system, where the patient can book a particular doctor for a specific
treatment. No complicated registration or appointment system. We made a complicated
system for making your user experience reliable. We made this user-friendly system
from kids to olds. Patients will not get confused when every single data is user friendly.
